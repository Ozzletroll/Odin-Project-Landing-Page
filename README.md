Odin Project Landing Page

This is an example landing page made as part of the Odin Project
Foundations course.

It should be scaleable for a variety of monitor sizes, and also
be suitable for mobile devices.

As a learning exercise, this project served to provide an introduction to HTML and CSS, 
as well as an opportunity to learn good working practices with Git and Github.
